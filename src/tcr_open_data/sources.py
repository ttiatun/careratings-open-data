Source registry: the CMS files a release is built from, with their exact headers.

Every header below was read from the live files in September 2026. A build
compares each downloaded file against its expected header before mapping a
single row: a renamed or missing CMS column stops the build with the names
involved, rather than silently loading NULLs.
